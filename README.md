To create the project, I used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) aiming for overall optimization. Additionally, I chose the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library for development. Consequently, I implemented all the styling using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/). For consuming the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), I utilized [Axios](https://axios-http.com/ptbr/docs/intro). The management of routes was carried out through [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main). As for the project's commit pattern, I adopted [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
